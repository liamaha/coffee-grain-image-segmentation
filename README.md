# coffee-grain-image-segmentation
This python application is being worked on using Visual Studio 2019 with the openCV package for object detection of coffee grinds.

The data folder contains a small selection of jpeg images which the python program will cycle through and analyse before writing the analysis results to image_measurements.csv. The zipped images folder contains a larger set of images which can be placed in the data folder for testing.
